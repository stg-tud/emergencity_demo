= Readme

This is an https://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt] project, the sbt launcher script is included,
so all commands should work with only a local JVM installed. Tested on openjdk-11.
`./sbt` launches an interactive compile shell, which makes incremental compilation much faster,
for batch processing, use `./sbt some commands`

Examples:

....
# compile the project
./sbt compile

# run the server
./sbt server/run

# commandline parameters
./sbt "server/run ar1 arg2"
....


== Deployment

....
# deploy to jars + scripts
./sbt stage
....

This produces a folder containing a standalone version of the server in

....
./server/target/universal/stage
....

which can then be executed the same as the `run` command above:

....
cd ./server/target/universal/stage
bin/
....


=== Change MQTT broker address

Add the websocket url of the broker to the url hash of the applicaiton, e.g.,
`http://0.0.0.0:9110/#ws://127.0.0.1:9001/` and refresh the page.


== Add entries

=== Via HTTP:

....
curl --data-urlencode "title=test" --data-urlencode "description=test description" --data-urlencode "imageUrl=http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/uncyclopedia/images/0/0a/Ohnoes.jpg/revision/latest?cb\x3d20061026122429"  "http://0.0.0.0:9110/add-entry"
....

Note that sending Data URLs instead of actual URLs should make images available even without internet.
Data urls have the format: `data:image/png;base64,base64dataHere`

== Observe entries

The application chatters on the MQTT topic `ersir/entries`.
The Data is a JSON object containing all interesting applicaiton state.


== Installing as a Web App

To install, the app must be accessed from an https url.
If the websocket target is NOT `wss` then browsers will not allow that connection,
in Firefox, set the following to true to disable security:
`network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS`.

â€¦ but then you can no longer configure the `wss`. Dang.
